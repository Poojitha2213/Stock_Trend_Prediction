Title: Stock Trend Prediction Mini-Project

Description:
The Stock Trend Prediction mini-project is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of time series analysis and predictive modeling using Python. This project utilizes popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Pandas DataReader, and Yahoo Finance (yfinance) to retrieve historical stock data, visualize trends, and build a simple predictive model.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Retrieval**: Utilize the Pandas DataReader and Yahoo Finance libraries to fetch historical stock data. This step involves selecting a specific stock symbol and defining a timeframe for analysis.

2. **Data Exploration**: Employ Pandas to explore the fetched data, including examining its structure, summarizing statistics, and identifying any missing values or anomalies.

3. **Data Visualization**: Utilize Matplotlib to create insightful visualizations such as time series plots, candlestick charts, and moving averages to identify trends and patterns in the stock data.

4. **Trend Prediction**: Implement a basic predictive model using techniques such as linear regression, moving averages, or other time series forecasting methods. This model aims to predict future stock prices based on historical trends.

**Code Structure:**

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas_datareader as data
import yfinance as yf

# Data Retrieval
stock_symbol = 'AAPL'  # Example stock symbol (can be replaced with any valid symbol)
start_date = '2020-01-01'  # Define start date for data retrieval
end_date = '2021-01-01'    # Define end date for data retrieval
stock_data = yf.download(stock_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Data Exploration
print(stock_data.head())     # Display the first few rows of the data
print(stock_data.describe()) # Summary statistics of the data
# Check for missing values and handle them if necessary

# Data Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(stock_data['Close'], label='Close Price', color='blue')
plt.title('Historical Stock Prices')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Trend Prediction
# Implement your predictive model here
```

**Expected Outcome:**

By the end of this mini-project, you should have gained hands-on experience in fetching historical stock data, visualizing trends, and building a simple predictive model. You will have a deeper understanding of the steps involved in stock trend analysis and prediction, which can serve as a foundation for more advanced projects in financial forecasting and machine learning.
